    <p><b>The Volkswagen Atlas</b> was VW's first swing at a three-row midsize SUV, and the automaker knocked it out of the park. Its roomy cabin and comfortable ride helped place it near the top of the pack when it debuted in 2018. But new competitors and a rapidly evolving market mean Volkswagen feels the need to offer some updates to keep the Atlas fresh.
      On the outside, the 2021 Volkswagen Atlas</br> gets restyled headlights, bumpers, taillights and a new grille. The interior receives some mild changes such as a new steering wheel and the addition of new driver aids including a system that can scan traffic signs. This latter feature can help you know what the speed limit of the road you're on, even if you didn't see the sign yourself.
          Alas, the Atlas is powered by the same engines as before: a turbocharged 235-horsepower four-cylinder and a 276-hp six-cylinder engine. We think Volkswagen missed an opportunity here to add some power under the hood since even the optional six-cylinder lacks the power to get this big SUV moving with any real authority. Overall, though, the 2021 VW Atlas is still a compelling contender among three-row family SUVs.
