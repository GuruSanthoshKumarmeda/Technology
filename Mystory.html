	   <h2>Story:</h2>
<pre style="500px">The story begins in an hospital.Initially both Valmiki and jayaram usedto work together but Ramchandram after marrying Yasu becomes rich but 
Valmiki asusualremains poor.Both of their wifes give birth to their children at a time.But the Nurse Sulochana assumes that the child of Jayram was died and goes 
to call jayram but Valmiki confronts her and with his kind cunning words exchanges the children.But after a few minutes the child cries and when nurse requests 
valmiki  to place the children with their right mothersbut valmiki wants his child to be rich and rejects her and throws her where she goes to comma.
		And the biological child of Ramachandram(AlluArjun) lives with Valmiki and biological child of Valmiki(Sushant)lives a rich life with Ramachandram.
There begins the main story and AlluArjun is named Bantu and Sushant is named Raj after a few years he starts working in a travelling agency named 
<h3=style"color:green";>Pack your Bags</h3>where Ammu(PoojaHegde) is the HR of the company and he falls in love with her.One day jayaram wants his on to take charge of the
company and sends him to discuss over the shares through port with Paiditalli but he is unable to speak,this worries Ramchandram a lot.Meanwhile to the same 
hotel Ammu and Bantu comes to meet Sudarshan;a financist who sold the travelling agency to Ammu.He asks Ammu to return his travelling agency back and warns her but 
AlluArjun  with his muscular power and fears Sudarshan.And this courage and telling truth without fearing loves Ramachandram and feels happy if Bantu were his son.
Later Apala Naidu,who is the owner of Kakinada port and the father of Paiditalli wants to take action on Ramachandram for not accepting the proposal of his son and 
inserts tip of an umbrella in to an heart of Ramachadram.
	        Meanwhile,Bantu and Ammu who come to meet Ramachandram sees his drastic condition and joins him in hospital.There comes the turning point in the 
movie where Bantu comes to know the truth while saving the nurse Sulochana;who knows the truth and from there Bantu swears to look after their biological 
parents and with a plan by kidnapping doctor Shrinivas's son,he enters in to the heaven home.And in that home he transforms everyone with his intelligence and 
oneday he is thrown from that heaven home for misbehaving with Ammu;who is supposed to marry Raj but in love with Bantu.Finally,the story ends with the reveal 
of Bantu as the son of Ramchandram but this reveal is not known to the mother Yasu and also the reveal of how Raj was supposed to be by his grandfather.
This is somewhat diffrenec from the previous movies because Bantu doesn'twant to leave the mother who fed him.
